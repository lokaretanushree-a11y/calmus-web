## 🏆 Hackathon Problem Statement

College students face increasing academic pressure, emotional stress, and limited access to mental health support. Many students struggle silently due to stigma, lack of awareness, or absence of immediate, approachable tools.

**CALMUS** addresses this gap by providing a safe, private, and intuitive platform for students to reflect on their emotions, track wellbeing trends, and receive supportive guidance.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

CALMUS enables students to:

- Express how they feel through daily check-ins  
- Receive emotion-aware suggestions instantly  
- Visualize mood patterns over time  
- Access campus wellness resources easily  

The MVP focuses on **early emotional awareness**, helping students recognize when they may need rest, support, or professional help.
